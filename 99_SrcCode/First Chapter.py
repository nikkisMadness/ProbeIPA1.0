"""Far out in the ocean the water is as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower, 
and as clear as the purest glass. But it is very deep too. It goes down deeper than any anchor rope will go, 
and many, many steeples would have to be stacked one on top of another to 
reach from the bottom to the surface of the sea. It is down there that the sea folk live.

The sea king down there had been a widower for years, 
and his old mother kept house for him. She was a clever woman, 
but very proud of her noble birth. Therefore she flaunted twelve oysters on her tail 
while the other ladies of the court were only allowed to wear six. 
Except for this she was an altogether praiseworthy person, 
particularly so because she was extremely fond of her granddaughters, 
the little sea princesses. 
They were six lovely girls, but the youngest was the most beautiful of them all. 
Her skin was as soft and tender as a rose petal, 
and her eyes were as blue as the deep sea, but like all the others she had no feet. 
Her body ended in a fish tail.
""",
"""Each little princess had her own small garden plot, where she could dig 
and plant whatever she liked. 
One of them made her little flower bed in the shape of a whale, 
another thought it neater to shape hers like a little mermaid, 
but the youngest of them made hers as round as the sun, 
and there she grew only flowers which were as red as the sun itself. 
She was an unusual child, quiet and wistful, 
and when her sisters decorated their gardens with all kinds of odd things they had found 
in sunken ships, she would allow nothing in hers except flowers as red as the sun, 
and a pretty marble statue. This figure of a handsome boy, carved in pure white marble, 
had sunk down to the bottom of the sea from some ship that was wrecked. 
Beside the statue she planted a rose-colored weeping willow tree, 
which thrived so well that its graceful branches shaded the statue and hung down to the blue sand, 
where their shadows took on a violet tint, and swayed as the branches swayed. 
It looked as if the roots and the tips of the branches were kissing each other in play.

Nothing gave the youngest princess such pleasure as to hear about the world of 
human beings up above them. 
Her old grandmother had to tell her all she knew about ships and cities, 
and of people and animals. What seemed nicest of all to her was that up on 
land the flowers were fragrant, for those at the bottom of the sea had no scent. 
And she thought it was nice that the woods were green, 
and that the fish you saw among their branches could sing so loud and sweet 
that it was delightful to hear them. Her grandmother had to call the little birds "fish", 
or the princess would not have known what she was talking about, for she had never seen a bird.
""",
""""When you get to be fifteen," her grandmother said, 
"you will be allowed to rise up out of the ocean and sit on the rocks in the moonlight, 
to watch the great ships sailing by. You will see woods and towns, too."

Next year one of her sisters would be fifteen, but the others - well, 
since each was a whole year older than the next the youngest still had five long years 
to wait until she could rise up from the water and see what our world was like. 
Their grandmother had not told them half enough, 
and there were so many thing that they longed to know about.

The most eager of them all was the youngest, 
the very one who was so quiet and wistful. Many a night 
she stood by her open window and looked up through the dark blue water 
where the fish waved their fins and tails. She could just see the moon and stars. 
To be sure, their light was quite dim, but looked at through the water 
they seemed much bigger than they appear to us. 
Whenever a cloud-like shadow swept across them, 
she knew that it was either a whale swimming overhead, 
or a ship with many human beings aboard it. 
Little did they dream that a pretty young mermaid was down below, 
stretching her white arms up toward the keel of their ship.
""",

"""And at last she too came to be fifteen.

"Now I'll have you off my hands," said her grandmother, 
the old queen dowager. "Come, let me adorn you like your sisters." 
In the little maid's hair she put a wreath of white lilies, 
each petal of which was formed from half of a pearl. 
And the old queen let eight big oysters fasten themselves 
to the princess's tail, as a sign of her high rank.

"But that hurts!" said the little mermaid.

"You must put up with a good deal to keep up appearances," her grandmother told her.""",

"""Oh, how gladly she would have shaken off all these decorations, 
and laid aside the cumbersome wreath! 
The red flowers in her garden were much more becoming to her, 
but she didn't dare to make any changes. "Good-by," she said, 
and up she went through the water, as light and as sparkling as a bubble.

The sun had just gone down when her head rose above the surface, 
but the clouds still shone like gold and roses, and in the delicately 
tinted sky sparkled the clear gleam of the evening star. 
The air was mild and fresh and the sea unruffled. 
A great three-master lay in view with only one of all its sails set, 
for there was not even the whisper of a breeze, 
and the sailors idled about in the rigging and on the yards. 
There was music and singing on the ship, 
and as night came on they lighted hundreds of such brightly colored 
lanterns that one might have thought the flags of all nations were swinging in the air.""",

"""The little mermaid swam right up to the window of the main cabin, 
and each time she rose with the swell she could peep in through the 
clear glass panes at the crowd of brilliantly dressed people within. 
The handsomest of them all was a young Prince with big dark eyes. 
He could not be more than sixteen years old. 
It was his birthday and that was the reason for all the celebration. 
Up on deck the sailors were dancing, and when the Prince appeared among 
them a hundred or more rockets flew through the air, making it as bright as day. 
These startled the little mermaid so badly that she ducked under the water. 
But she soon peeped up again, and then it seemed 
as if all the stars in the sky were falling around her.
Never had she seen such fireworks. Great suns spun around, 
splendid fire-fish floated through the blue air, 
and all these things were mirrored in the crystal clear sea. 
It was so brilliantly bright that you could see every little rope of the ship, 
and the people could be seen distinctly. 
Oh, how handsome the young Prince was! He laughed, 
and he smiled and shook people by the hand, while the music rang out in the perfect evening.""",

"""It got very late, but the little mermaid could not take her eyes off 
the ship and the handsome Prince. The brightly colored lanterns were put out, 
no more rockets flew through the air, and no more cannon boomed. 

Now the ship began to sail. Canvas after canvas was spread in the wind, 
the waves rose high, great clouds gathered, and lightning flashed in the distance. 
Ah, they were in for a terrible storm, and the mariners made haste to reef the sails. 
The tall ship pitched and rolled as it sped through the angry sea. The ship creaked and labored, 
thick timbers gave way under the heavy blows, waves broke over the ship, 
the mainmast snapped in two like a reed, the ship listed over on its side, 
and water burst into the hold.""",

"""Now the little mermaid saw that people were in peril, 
and that she herself must take care to avoid the beams 
and wreckage tossed about by the sea. One moment it would be black as pitch, 
and she couldn't see a thing. Next moment the lightning would flash so brightly 
that she could distinguish every soul on board. 
Everyone was looking out for himself as best he could. 
She watched closely for the young Prince, 
and when the ship split in two she saw him sink down in the sea. 
At first she was overjoyed that he would be with her, 
but then she recalled that human people could not live under the water, 
and he could only visit her father's palace as a dead man. 
No, he should not die! So she swam in among all the floating planks and beams, 
completely forgetting that they might crush her. 
She dived through the waves and rode their crests, 
until at length she reached the young Prince, 
who was no longer able to swim in that raging sea. 
His arms and legs were exhausted, his beautiful eyes were closing, 
and he would have died if the little mermaid had not come to help him. 
She held his head above water, and let the waves take them wherever the waves went.""",


"""At daybreak, when the storm was over, not a trace of the ship was in view. 
The sun rose out of the waters, red and bright, 
and its beams seemed to bring the glow of life back to the cheeks of the Prince, 
but his eyes remained closed. The mermaid kissed his high and shapely forehead. 
As she stroked his wet hair in place, 
it seemed to her that he looked like that marble statue in her little garden. 
She kissed him again and hoped that he would live.

She saw dry land rise before her in high blue mountains, 
topped with snow as glistening white as if a flock of swans were resting there. 
Down by the shore were splendid green woods, and in the foreground stood a church, 
or perhaps a convent; she didn't know which, but anyway it was a building. 
Orange and lemon trees grew in its garden, and tall palm trees grew beside the gateway. 
Here the sea formed a little harbor, quite calm and very deep. 
Fine white sand had been washed up below the cliffs. 
She swam there with the handsome Prince, and stretched him out on the sand, 
taking special care to pillow his head up high in the warm sunlight.""",


"""The bells began to ring in the great white building, 
and a number of young girls came out into the garden. 
The little mermaid swam away behind some tall rocks that stuck out of the water. 
She covered her hair and her shoulders with foam so that no one could see her tiny face, 
and then she watched to see who would find the poor Prince.

In a little while one of the young girls came upon him. 
She seemed frightened, but only for a minute; then she called more people. 
The mermaid watched the Prince regain consciousness, 
and smile at everyone around him. But he did not smile at her, 
for he did not even know that she had saved him. She felt very unhappy, 
and when they led him away to the big building she dived sadly down into the water 
and returned to her father's palace.""",

"""She had always been quiet and wistful, and now she became much more so. 
Her sisters asked her what she had seen on her first visit up to the surface, 
but she would not tell them a thing.

She knew where he lived, many an evening 
and many a night she spent there in the sea. 
She swam much closer to shore than any of her sisters would dare venture, 
and she even went far up a narrow stream, 
under the splendid marble balcony that cast its long shadow in the water. 
Here she used to sit and watch the young Prince 
when he thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight.""",


"""Increasingly she grew to like human beings, 
and more and more she longed to live among them. 
Their world seemed so much wider than her own, 
for they could skim over the sea in ships, 
and mount up into the lofty peaks high over the clouds, 
and their lands stretched out in woods and fields farther than the eye could see. 
There was so much she wanted to know. Her sisters could not answer all her questions, 
so she asked her old grandmother, 
who knew about the "upper world," which was what she said was 
the right name for the countries above the sea.""",

""""If men aren't drowned," the little mermaid asked, 
"do they live on forever? Don't they die, as we do down here in the sea?"

"Yes," the old lady said, 
"they too must die, and their lifetimes are even shorter than ours. 
We can live to be three hundred years old, but when we perish we turn into mere foam on the sea, 
and haven't even a grave down here among our dear ones. 
We have no immortal soul, no life hereafter. 
We are like the green seaweed - once cut down, 
it never grows again. Human beings, on the contrary, 
have a soul which lives forever, long after their bodies have turned to clay. 
It rises through thin air, up to the shining stars. 
Just as we rise through the water to see the lands on earth, 
so men rise up to beautiful places unknown, which we shall never see."""",

""""Why weren't we given an immortal soul?" the little mermaid sadly asked. 
"I would gladly give up my three hundred years if I could be a human being only for a day, 
and later share in that heavenly realm."

"You must not think about that," said the old lady. 
"We fare much more happily and are much better off than the folk up there."

"Then I must also die and float as foam upon the sea, not hearing the music of the waves, 
and seeing neither the beautiful flowers nor the red sun! 
Can't I do anything at all to win an immortal soul?"""",

""""No," her grandmother answered, 
"not unless a human being loved you so much that you meant more 
to him than his father and mother. 
If his every thought and his whole heart cleaved to you so that he 
would let a priest join his right hand to yours and would promise to be 
faithful here and throughout all eternity, then his soul would dwell in your body, 
and you would share in the happiness of mankind. 
He would give you a soul and yet keep his own. 
But that can never come to pass. The very thing that is your greatest 
beauty here in the sea - your fish tail - would be considered ugly on land. 
They have such poor taste that to be thought beautiful there you have 
to have two awkward props which they call legs."""",

"""The little mermaid sighed and looked unhappily at her fish tail.

"Come, let us be gay!" the old lady said. 
"Let us leap and bound throughout the three hundred years that we have to live. 
Surely that is time and to spare, and afterwards we shall be glad enough to rest in our graves. 
- We are holding a court ball this evening."

You could see the countless fish, great and small, swimming toward the glass walls. 
On some of them the scales gleamed purplish-red, while others were silver and gold. 
Across the floor of the hall ran a wide stream of water, 
and upon this the mermaids and mermen danced to their own entrancing songs.""",

"""The little mermaid sang more sweetly than anyone else, 
and everyone applauded her. For a moment her heart was happy, 
because she knew she had the loveliest voice of all, in the sea or on the land. 
But her thoughts soon strayed to the world up above. She could not forget the charming Prince, 
nor her sorrow that she did not have an immortal soul like his. 
Therefore she stole out of her father's palace and, 
while everything there was song and gladness, she sat sadly in her own little garden.""",

"""Then she heard a bugle call through the water, and she thought, 
"That must mean he is sailing up there, he whom I love more than my father or mother, 
he of whom I am always thinking, 
and in whose hands I would so willingly trust my lifelong happiness. 
I dare do anything to win him and to gain an immortal soul. 
While my sisters are dancing here, in my father's palace, 
I shall visit the sea witch of whom I have always been so afraid. 
Perhaps she will be able to advise me and help me.""""
