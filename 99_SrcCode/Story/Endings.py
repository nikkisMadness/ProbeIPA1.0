"""But then she flung it from her, far out over the waves. Where it fell the waves were red, 
as if bubbles of blood seethed in the water. 
With eyes already glazing she looked once more at the Prince, 
hurled herself over the bulwarks into the sea, and felt her body dissolve in foam.""",

"""The sun rose up from the waters. Its beams fell, warm and kindly, 
upon the chill sea foam, and the little mermaid did not feel the hand of death. 
In the bright sunlight overhead,she saw hundreds of fair ethereal beings. 
They were so transparent that through them she could see the ship's 
white sails and the red clouds in the sky. Their voices were sheer music, 
but so spirit-like that no human ear could detect the sound, 
just as no eye on earth could see their forms. Without wings, 
they floated as light as the air itself. The little mermaid discovered 
that she was shaped like them, and that she was gradually rising up out of the foam.

'Who are you, toward whom I rise?' she asked, and her voice sounded like those above her, 
so spiritual that no music on earth could match it.""",

"""'We are the daughters of the air,' they answered. 
'A mermaid has no immortal soul, and can never get one unless 
she wins the love of a human being. Her eternal life must depend upon a power outside herself. 
The daughters of the air do not have an immortal soul either, 
but they can earn one by their good deeds. We fly to the south, 
where the hot poisonous air kills human beings unless we bring cool breezes. 
We carry the scent of flowers through the air, 
bringing freshness and healing balm wherever we go. 
When for three hundred years we have tried to do all the good that we can, 
we are given an immortal soul and a share in mankind's eternal bliss. 
You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do this too. 
Your suffering and your loyalty have raised you up into the realm of airy spirits, 
and now in the course of three hundred years 
you may earn by your good deeds a soul that will never die.'""",

"""The little mermaid lifted her clear bright eyes toward God's sun, 
and for the first time her eyes were wet with tears.

On board the ship all was astir and lively again. 
She saw the Prince and his fair bride in search of her. 
Then they gazed sadly into the seething foam, 
as if they knew she had hurled herself into the waves. 
Unseen by them, she kissed the bride's forehead, smiled upon the Prince, 
and rose up with the other daughters of the air to the rose-red clouds that sailed on high.""",

"""'This is the way that we shall rise to the kingdom of God, after three hundred years have passed.'

'We may get there even sooner,' one spirit whispered. 
'Unseen, we fly into the homes of men, where there are children, 
and for every day on which we find a good child who pleases his parents and deserves their love, 
God shortens our days of trial. The child does not know when we float through his room, 
but when we smile at him in approval one year is taken from our three hundred. 
But if we see a naughty, mischievous child we must shed tears of sorrow, 
and each tear adds a day to the time of our trial.'
