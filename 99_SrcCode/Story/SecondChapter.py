"""The little mermaid set out from her garden toward 
the whirlpools that raged in front of the witch's dwelling. 
She had never gone that way before. No flowers grew there, nor any seaweed. 
Bare and gray, the sands extended to the whirlpools,
where like roaring mill wheels the waters whirled and snatched everything 
within their reach down to the bottom of the sea. 
Between these tumultuous whirlpools she had to thread her way to reach the witch's waters, 
and then for a long stretch the only trail lay through a hot seething mire, 
which the witch called her peat marsh.""",

"""She reached a large muddy clearing in the forest, where big fat water snakes slithered about, 
showing their foul yellowish bellies. 
In the middle of this clearing was a house built of the bones of shipwrecked men, 
and there sat the sea witch, 
letting a toad eat out of her mouth just as we might feed sugar to a little canary bird. 
She called the ugly fat water snakes her little chickabiddies, 
and let them crawl and sprawl about on her spongy bosom.""",

"""'I know exactly what you want,' said the sea witch. 
'It is very foolish of you, but just the same you shall have your way, 
for it will bring you to grief, my proud princess. 
You want to get rid of your fish tail and have two props instead, 
so that you can walk about like a human creature, 
and have the young Prince fall in love with you, and win him and an immortal soul besides.' 
At this, the witch gave such a loud cackling laugh that the toad and the snakes were shaken to the ground, 
where they lay writhing.""",

"""'You are just in time,' said the witch. 
'After the sun comes up tomorrow, 
a whole year would have to go by before I could be of any help to you. 
J shall compound you a draught, and before sunrise you must swim to the shore with it, 
seat yourself on dry land, and drink the draught down. 
Then your tail will divide and shrink until it becomes what 
the people on earth call a pair of shapely legs. 
But it will hurt; it will feel as if a sharp sword slashed through you. 
Everyone who sees you will say that you are the most graceful human being they have ever laid eyes on, 
for you will keep your gliding movement 
and no dancer will be able to tread as lightly as you. 
But every step you take will feel as if you were treading 
upon knife blades so sharp that blood must flow. 
I am willing to help you, but are you willing to suffer all this?'""",

"""'Yes,' the little mermaid said in a trembling voice, 
as she thought of the Prince and of gaining a human soul.
'Remember!' said the witch. 'Once you have taken a human form, you can never be a mermaid again. 
You can never come back through the waters to your sisters, 
or to your father's palace. And if you do not win the love of the Prince so completely 
that for your sake he forgets his father and mother, 
cleaves to you with his every thought and his whole heart, and lets the priest join your hands in marriage, 
then you will win no immortal soul. 
If he marries someone else, your heart will break on the very next morning, 
and you will become foam of the sea.'

'I shall take that risk,' said the little mermaid, but she turned as pale as death.""",

"""'Also, you will have to pay me,' 
said the witch, 'and it is no trifling price that I'm asking. 
You have the sweetest voice of anyone down here at the bottom of the sea, 
and while I don't doubt that you would like to captivate the Prince with it, 
you must give this voice to me. 
I will take the very best thing that you have, in return for my sovereign draught. 
I must pour my own blood in it to make the drink as sharp as a two-edged sword.'

'But if you take my voice,' said the little mermaid, 'what will be left to me?'""",

"""'Your lovely form,' the witch told her, 
'your gliding movements, and your eloquent eyes. 
With these you can easily enchant a human heart. 
Well, have you lost your courage? Stick out your little tongue and I shall cut it off. 
I'll have my price, and you shall have the potent draught.'

'Go ahead,' said the little mermaid.""",

"""The witch hung her caldron over the flames, to brew the draught. 
She tied her snakes in a knot and scoured out the pot with them. 
Then she pricked herself in the chest and let her black blood splash into the caldron. 
Steam swirled up from it, in such ghastly shapes that 
anyone would have been terrified by them. 
The witch constantly threw new ingredients into the caldron, 
and it started to boil with a sound like that of a crocodile shedding tears. 
When the draught was ready at last, it looked as clear as the purest water.""",

"""'There's your draught,' said the witch. 
And she cut off the tongue of the little mermaid, 
who now was dumb and could neither sing nor talk.

It glittered in the little mermaid's hand as if it were a shining star. 
So she soon traversed the marsh, and the place of raging whirlpools.""",


"""The sun had not yet risen when she saw the Prince's palace. 
As she climbed his splendid marble staircase, the moon was shining clear. 
The little mermaid swallowed the bitter, fiery draught, 
and it was as if a two-edged sword struck through her frail body. 
She swooned away, and lay there as if she were dead. 
When the sun rose over the sea she awoke and felt a flash of pain, 
but directly in front of her stood the handsome young Prince, 
gazing at her with his coal-black eyes. Lowering her gaze, 
she saw that her fish tail was gone, 
and that she had the loveliest pair of white legs any young maid could hope to have. 
But she was naked, so she clothed herself in her own long hair.""",

"""The Prince asked who she was, and how she came to be there. 
Her deep blue eyes looked at him tenderly but very sadly, for she could not speak. 
Then he took her hand and led her into his palace. 
Every footstep felt as if she were walking on the blades and points of sharp knives, 
just as the witch had foretold, but she gladly endured it. 
She moved as lightly as a bubble as she walked beside the Prince. 
He and all who saw her marveled at the grace of her gliding walk.""",

"""Once clad in the rich silk and muslin garments that were provided for her, 
she was the loveliest person in all the palace, 
though she was dumb and could neither sing nor speak. 
'Oh,' she thought, 'if he only knew that I parted with my voice forever so that I could be near him.'""",

"""Graceful slaves now began to dance to the most wonderful music. 
Then the little mermaid lifted her shapely white arms, rose up on the tips of her toes, 
and skimmed over the floor. No one had ever danced so well. 
Each movement set off her beauty to better and better advantage, 
and her eyes spoke more directly to the heart than any of the singing slaves could do.""",

"""She charmed everyone, and especially the Prince, who called her his dear little foundling. 
She danced time and again, though every time she touched the floor 
she felt as if she were treading on sharp-edged steel. 
The Prince said he would keep her with him always, 
and that she was to have a velvet pillow to sleep on outside his door.""",


"""Day after day she became more dear to the Prince, 
who loved her as one would love a good little child, 
but he never thought of making her his Queen. 
Yet she had to be his wife or she would never have an immortal soul, 
and on the morning after his wedding she would turn into foam on the waves.

'Don't you love me best of all?' the little mermaid's eyes seemed to question him, 
when he took her in his arms and kissed her lovely forehead.""",

"""'Yes, you are most dear to me,' said the Prince, 'for you have the kindest heart. 
You love me more than anyone else does, and you look so much 
like a young girl I once saw but never shall find again. 
I was on a ship that was wrecked, and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple, 
where many young girls performed the rituals. 
The youngest of them found me beside the sea and saved my life. 
Though I saw her no more than twice, she is the only person in all the world whom I could love. 
But you are so much like her that you almost replace the memory of her in my heart. 
She belongs to that holy temple, therefore it is my good fortune that I have you. 
We shall never part.'""",

"""'Alas, he doesn't know it was I who saved his life,' the little mermaid thought. 
'I carried him over the sea to the garden where the temple stands. 
I hid behind the foam and watched to see if anyone would come. 
I saw the pretty maid he loves better than me.' 
A sigh was the only sign of her deep distress, for a mermaid cannot cry. 
'He says that the other maid belongs to the holy temple. 
She will never come out into the world, so they will never see each other again. 
It is I who will care for him, love him, and give all my life to him.'""",

"""Now rumors arose that the Prince was to wed the beautiful daughter of a neighboring King, 
and that it was for this reason he was having such a superb ship made ready to sail. 
The rumor ran that the Prince's real interest in visiting 
the neighboring kingdom was to see the King's daughter, and that he 
was to travel with a lordly retinue. 
The little mermaid shook her head and smiled, for she knew the Prince's 
thoughts far better than anyone else did.""",

"""'I am forced to make this journey,' he told her. 
'I must visit the beautiful Princess, for this is my parents' wish, 
but they would not have me bring her home as my bride against my own will, 
and I can never love her. She does not resemble the lovely maiden in the temple, 
as you do, and if I were to choose a bride, I would sooner choose you, 
my dear mute foundling with those telling eyes of yours.' 
And he kissed her on the mouth, fingered her long hair, 
and laid his head against her heart so that she came 
to dream of mortal happiness and an immortal soul.""",

"""'I trust you aren't afraid of the sea, my silent child ' he said, 
as they went on board the magnificent vessel that was 
to carry them to the land of the neighboring King. 
And he told her stories of storms, of ships becalmed, 
of strange deep-sea fish, and of the wonders that divers have seen. 
She smiled at such stories, for no one knew about the bottom of the sea as well as she did.""",

"""In the clear moonlight, when everyone except the man at the helm was asleep, 
she sat on the side of the ship gazing down through the transparent water, 
and fancied she could catch glimpses of her father's palace. 
On the topmost tower stood her old grandmother, 
wearing her silver crown and looking up at the keel of the ship through the rushing waves. 
Then her sisters rose to the surface, looked at her sadly, 
and wrung their white hands. She smiled and waved, 
trying to let them know that all went well and that she was happy. 
But along came the cabin boy, and her sisters dived 
out of sight so quickly that the boy supposed the flash of 
white he had seen was merely foam on the sea.""",

"""Next morning the ship came in to the harbor of the neighboring King's glorious city. 
All the church bells chimed, and trumpets were sounded from all the high towers, 
while the soldiers lined up with flying banners and glittering bayonets. 
Every day had a new festivity, as one ball or levee followed another, 
but the Princess was still to appear. 
They said she was being brought up in some far-away sacred temple, 
where she was learning every royal virtue. But she came at last.

The little mermaid was curious to see how beautiful this Princess was, 
and she had to grant that a more exquisite figure she had never seen. 
The Princess's skin was clear and fair, and behind the long, 
dark lashes her deep blue eyes were smiling and devoted.""",

"""'It was you!' the Prince cried. 'You are the one who saved me 
when I lay like a dead man beside the sea.' 
He clasped the blushing bride of his choice in his arms. 
'Oh, I am happier than a man should be!' he told his little mermaid. 
'My fondest dream - that which I never dared to hope - has come true. 
You will share in my great joy, for you love me more than anyone does.'

The little mermaid kissed his hand and felt that her heart was beginning to break. 
For the morning after his wedding day would see her dead and turned to watery foam.""",




"""And one day the Prince took the Princess and the little Mermaid to a nerby cliff to have a picnic.
He told her on the way that this might be the most important day in his life.
When they were by the cliff the Prince excused himself to go and find some wood so the to laydies woldn't 
be cold.

And as the Princess was standing by the Cliff the little Mermaid asked herself 'What if she fell?'."""
