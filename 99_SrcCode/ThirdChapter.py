"""All the church bells rang out, and heralds rode through the streets to announce the wedding. 
Upon every altar sweet-scented oils were burned in costly silver lamps. 
The priests swung their censers, the bride and the bridegroom joined their hands, 
and the bishop blessed their marriage. The little mermaid, 
clothed in silk and cloth of gold, held the bride's train, 
but she was deaf to the wedding march and blind to the holy ritual. 
Her thought turned on her last night upon earth, and on all she had lost in this world.""",

"""That same evening, the bride and bridegroom went aboard the ship. 
Cannon thundered and banners waved. 
The little mermaid could not forget that first time she rose 
from the depths of the sea and looked on at such pomp and happiness. 
Light as a swallow pursued by his enemies, she joined in the whirling dance. 
Everyone cheered her, for never had she danced so wonderfully. 
Her tender feet felt as if they were pierced by daggers, but she did not feel it. 
Her heart suffered far greater pain. 
She knew that this was the last evening that she ever would see him 
for whom she had forsaken her home and family, 
for whom she had sacrificed her lovely voice and suffered such constant torment, 
while he knew nothing of all these things. 
It was the last night that she would breathe the same air with him, 
or look upon deep waters or the star fields of the blue sky.""",

"""A hush came over the ship. Only the helmsman remained 
on deck as the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the bulwarks 
and looked to the east to see the first red hint of daybreak, 
for she knew that the first flash of the sun would strike her dead. 
Then she saw her sisters rise up among the waves. They were as pale as she, 
and there was no sign of their lovely long hair that the breezes used to blow. 
It had all been cut off.""",

"""'We have given our hair to the witch,' they said, 
'so that she would send you help, and save you from death tonight. 
She gave us a knife. Here it is. See the sharp blade! Before the sun rises, 
you must strike it into the Prince's heart, 
and when his warm blood bathes your feet they will grow together and become a fish tail. 
Then you will be a mermaid again, able to come back to us in the sea, 
and live out your three hundred years before you die and turn into dead salt sea foam. 
Make haste! He or you must die before sunrise. 
Our old grandmother is so grief-stricken that her white hair is falling fast, 
just as ours did under the witch's scissors. Kill the Prince and come back to us. 
Hurry! Hurry! See that red glow in the heavens! 
In a few minutes the sun will rise and you must die.' 
So saying, they gave a strange deep sigh and sank beneath the waves.""",

"""The little mermaid parted the purple curtains of the tent and saw 
the beautiful bride asleep with her head on the Prince's breast. 
The mermaid bent down and kissed his shapely forehead. She looked at the sky, 
fast reddening for the break of day. She looked at the sharp knife and again 
turned her eyes toward the Prince, who in his sleep murmured the name of his bride. 
His thoughts were all for her, and the knife blade trembled in the mermaid's hand.
